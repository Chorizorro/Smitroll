	<h1>Dafuq is that shit?</h1>
	<p>
		Once upon a time, there was a MOBA game called <a href="https://account.hirezstudios.com/smitegame/" title="SMITE official website" target="_blank">SMITE</a> made by <a href="http://www.hirezstudios.com/hirezwp/" title="Hi-Rez official website" target="_blank">Hi-Rez Studios</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		This game was not so bad but those guys from Hi-Rez forgot to put a <span class="rainbowfy">random pick button</span> when selecting gods. So I decided to do it by myself, and to go further by copying what <a href="http://www.ultimate-bravery.com/?lang=en" title="Ultimate Bravery website for those LoL players suckers" target="_blank">Ultimate Bravery</a> did for <a href="http://euw.leagueoflegends.com/" title="League of Legends official website" target="_blank">League of Legends</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		The final goal is to make chaotic games with stupid build, make your allies rage against you and OMG LOOK AT THAT BUILD WHAT A NOOB!1!!!11, and also humilate your enemis by winning games while playing a god you don't know built like if you were drunk, on mushrooms high and listening to <a href="http://rebeccablackonline.com/" title="You shouldn't click on that link, I mean, seriously" target="_blank">Rebecca Black</a>'s discography. Because it's fun. YES IT IS!
	</p>
	<h1>Who did that shit?</h1>
	<p>
		A (bad) MOBA player which is fed up of losing games because he's a noob and building a whole website to make an excuse of losing that much.
	</p>
	<p>
		You'll find me in game as <a href="http://account.hirezstudios.com/smitegame/stats.aspx?player=Chorizorro" title="Profile page on SMITE web-site" target="_blank">Chorizorro</a>. I'm bad, I rage a lot and it seems I'm doing <span class="rainbowfy">tons of drugs</span> at the same time when I'm playing SMITE.

	<h1>Can I steal that shit and pretend I did it and stuff?</h1>
	<p>
		There's no copyright of any kind, no licence, you can do absolutely what you want with my code, my poor design, you can steal it, plagiarize it, wipe your ass with it and then eat it with mashed potatoes, I frankly don't give a fuck.
	</p>
	<h1>How can I contribute to that shit?</h1>
	<p>
		I'm afraid you can't at the moment. But soon, you will be able to add your stuff to my shit, and that'll definitely be the <span class="rainbowfy">most awesome shit eveeeeeer</span>.
